QUESTION 2. Write a program to print twin primes lessthan given number. If two consecutive odd numbers are bothprime then they are known as twin primes
Code:-
def prime(n):
  f = 0
  for i in range(2,(n//2)+1):
    if n%i==0:
       f = 1
       break
  return f

num = int(input("Enter the number"))

print("Twins Prime : ")
for i in range(2,num):
  if prime(i)==0 and prime(i+2)==0:
    print(i, "and" ,i+2);

Output:-
Twins Prime : 
3 and 5
5 and 7
11 and 13
17 and 19
