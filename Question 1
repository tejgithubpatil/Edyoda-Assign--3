QUESTION 1. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.
Code:
numbers = [8, 2, 3, 0, 7] #We are assigning value to number as list
def sum(numbers):
  total = 0  #we are defining and asssigning value to total to store total

  for x in numbers:
    total += x

  return total #we are returning value to function name 

print(sum(numbers)) #printing returned value

Output:-
20
